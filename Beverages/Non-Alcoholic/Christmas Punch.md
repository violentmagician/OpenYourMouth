## Ingredients


6 cups cranberry juice or pomegranate cranberry juice*
3 cups pineapple juice**
1 Tbsp almond extract
3 liters ginger ale
1 12 oz. bag fresh cranberries (optional)
2 fresh limes, sliced (optional)
Ice
Instructions
Pour cranberry juice, pineapple juice, and almond extract into a large drink dispenser and mix. Pour in ginger ale and give it one quick stir.

Add in cranberries, ice and ginger ale. Serve within a few hours for best results as it will start to go flat.




Recipe Notes
*This is not 100% cranberry juice, it is 100% juice but it has a blend of other juices in it such as grape, apple, pear. 100% cranberry juice would be much too tart here. Use something like Oceanspray.

**If you have room in your fridge preferably chill the soda and juices first or keep them in a cold (not freezing) garage, that way you don't need to add much ice and dilute it.
